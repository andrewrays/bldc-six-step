# Six Step Commutation of a BLDC Motor

## Description

MATLAB Project contains a model of six step (trapezoidal) commutation technique
used to control three-phase BLDC motor and required scripts.  
The model allows you to explore the main motor and control system characteristics
for closed-loop control system design. 

## Features

- Support of three conduction modes: 120 degree, 150 degree, and 180 degree
- Support of three commutation modes: nonsymmetrical (up and down), alternative
- Support of different wound types: wye and delta
- The following motor characteristics can be explored: speed, angle, stator currents,
  phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase voltages, current of the supply voltage sourse
- The following digital signals can be explored: Hall sensors signals and switching devices 
  control signals

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Simscape
- Simscape Electrical

Note: the project was created with MATLAB R2021b version.
